# tents-solver
Neat course project implementing a tents puzzle solver in assembly. Examples: https://www.puzzle-tents.com/ and https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/tents.html

Unfortunately, I do not have access to the assembler, linker, and simulator, which exist on university server
